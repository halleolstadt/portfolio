    <p>
     My name is Halle Olstadt and I am from Madison, WI. I have always been very into the outdoors such as hiking, fishing, swimming, and also taking photos of the outdoors. I travel a lot as my mom is a travel agent, so it has allowed me to expierence all sorts of amazing views in the outdoors. I've been to places such as Mexico, Jamaica, and even Ireland. Some of my goals include being able to get into the sports world with my communication's degree, or even use my multimedia knowledge to get into the field. A lifelong dream has been to be able to work for the Green Bay Packers, but I would love to work with any team.

        I have worked at Kwik Trip for the past three and a half years. It is an amazing company and I have admired their goal of treating each customer as a guest. I have created wonderful relationships with some of my guests over the years and the job has given me extremely strong communication and problem solving skills.

        I attended Madison College for two years and then transferred to UW-Eau Claire to finish my bachelors degree. I majored in Organizational Communications and minored in Multimedia Communications. In spring of 2024, I recieved a 4.0 GPA and have made Deans List multiple times. I spent a lot of time using Adobe software but also doing things such as planning the annual GEEKcon. For GEEKcon I coordinated all of the catering and communicated heavily within the community.
